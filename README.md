The portal aims to do away with the obselete system and introduce a systematic and digital solution by creating digital prescription along with maintanence of student's medical records and inventory management of pharmacy.

Students can log in with their IITISM gmail accounts. Doctor and Pharmacy will register their own accounts approved by the college.

Doctors can create digital prescriptions for a students using their admission numbers. They can check a student's previous medical records as well. While prescribing medicine he/she can check the available stock of that medicine in the inventory.
